Assuming that you started your first website based on `minima` theme from [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

```yaml

```yaml
layout: description
permalink: /about/

```yaml
home_text : [Your Text]
```

4. Create a new `categories.md` file in root with following yaml parameters
```yaml

4. In the `_congif.yml` file add following and change accordingly

Path is relative to the root directory

google_analytics: '[google analytics Id]'
disqus:

### Check here [_config.yml](https://github.com/rohitjain00/rohitjain00.github.io/blob/site/_config.yml) for example config file.


## Writing a new blog

Create a new folder `_posts` in root folder if not already exists.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at <https://github.com/rohitjain00/dev-portfolio-blog/.> This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `dev-portfolio-blog.gemspec` accordingly.
